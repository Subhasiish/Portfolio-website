```typescript
// Navbar.tsx connects with all sections through:
const mainSections = [
  'home', 'portfolio', 'services', 
  'about', 'achievements', 'contact'
];

// Smooth scrolling implementation
const scrollToSection = (sectionId: Section) => {
  // Handles both direct scrolling and route navigation
};
```

// CustomCursor.tsx interacts with all interactive elements:
- Links
- Buttons
- Interactive sections
// Uses event listeners and styled-components
```

// Background.tsx provides:
- Grid pattern
- Z-index layering
- Responsive sizing
// Connects with App.tsx as a base layer
```

8. **State Management**
```typescript
// Using React's built-in hooks:
- useState for local state
- useEffect for side effects
- useCallback for performance
- useRef for DOM references
```

9. **Styling System**
```typescript
// Using styled-components with:
- Global styles
- Component-specific styles
- Responsive design
- Theme integration
```

10. **Performance Optimizations**
```typescript
// Implemented through:
